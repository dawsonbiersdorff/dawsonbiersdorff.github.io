## Welcome to my page.
I made this for my CS-HU 250 class at Boise State and it's actually really cool.

I can make all kinds of edits that I like and maybe even add the projects I do throughout the years.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dawsonbiersdorff/dawsonbiersdorff.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
